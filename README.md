# RP6502-Fool-on-the-Hill
A tribute to the first great microcomputer hack!

On April 16, 1975, Homebrew Computer Club member [Steve Dompier used an Altair to play the Beatle's 'Fool in the Hill' via EM interference on an AM radio](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/audio/digibarn-radio/altair-music-erik-klein/foolonthehill.wav).

I thought it fitting that my first song for the RP6502 to be 'Fool on the Hill' as well. Enjoy!
